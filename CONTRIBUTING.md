## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Security Test Requirements
- **Threat Coverage**: Test must address real security threats
- **False Positive Management**: Minimize false positives
- **Performance**: Tests should complete within reasonable time
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across environments

### Test Categories
- `@pytest.mark.security` - Core security tests
- `@pytest.mark.fraud_detection` - Fraud-related tests
- `@pytest.mark.ml_analysis` - ML-based analysis tests
- `@pytest.mark.mobile_security` - Mobile security tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests

### Example Test Structure
```python
@pytest.mark.security
@pytest.mark.mobile_security
class TestNewSecurityFeature:
    """Test new security feature implementation"""
    
    def test_security_mechanism_effectiveness(self):
        """Test that security mechanism works as expected"""
        # Arrange
        setup_test_environment()
        
        # Act
        result = perform_security_test()
        
        # Assert
        assert result.security_level == "high"
        assert len(result.vulnerabilities) == 0
        
    def test_bypass_resistance(self):
        """Test resistance to common bypass techniques"""
        # Test various bypass attempts
        bypass_attempts = [
            attempt_method_hooking(),
            attempt_certificate_substitution(),
            attempt_environment_manipulation()
        ]
        
        for attempt in bypass_attempts:
            assert attempt.success == False
            assert attempt.detected == True
```

## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Review Criteria
1. **Security Impact**: Does it improve security testing?

## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python Style
```python
# Good
def detect_fraud_pattern(user_behavior: Dict[str, Any]) -> FraudAnalysis:
    """
    Analyze user behavior for fraud patterns.
    
    Args:
        user_behavior: Dictionary containing user behavioral data
        
    Returns:
        FraudAnalysis object with risk assessment
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If user_behavior is invalid
    """
    if not user_behavior:
        raise ValueError("User behavior data cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation
    return analysis_result
```

### Security Test Patterns
```python
# Security test pattern
def test_security_control():
    """Test that security control blocks malicious input"""
    # Arrange: Setup test conditions
    malicious_inputs = load_attack_vectors()
    
    # Act: Attempt attacks
    results = []
    for attack_vector in malicious_inputs:
        result = attempt_attack(attack_vector)
        results.append(result)
    
    # Assert: Verify protection
    for result in results:
        assert result.blocked == True
        assert result.logged == True
        assert not result.data_leaked
```
